<h3 id="diff"> <code> git diff </code> - See difference between two files </h3>

<p> Without any flags or options, the <code>git diff</code> command
will show the differences in any file that are in the current working
directory and the staging area. The output of the command is a patch file,
similar to the <code>diff</code> Linux/Unix command. Any difference can be
then patched with the <code>patch</code> command.

<ul>
<li> <code>git diff</code><br>
Show the diff of all files in the  <b>working directory</b> and
<b>staging area</b>.
<li> <code>git diff --cached</code> (or <code>--staged</code>)<br/>
See the diff of all files in the <b>staging area</b> and the most recent <b>commit</b>.
<li> <code>git diff c1ab343 4ab43ed</code><br/>
Diff of all files in <b>commit c1ab343</b> and <b>commit 4ab43ed</b>
<li> <code>git diff c1ab343 4ab43ed filename</code><br/>
<code>git diff c1ab343:filename 4ab43ed:filename</code><br/>
Same as above but <b>only for filename</b>.
<li> <code>git diff HEAD^ [filename]</code><br/>
<code>git diff HEAD~3 HEAD [filename]</code><br/>
Also works with <b>relative references.</b>
<li> <code>git diff @~4.. &gt; patchfile
<br> patch patchfile </code>
Save the diff as a patch file and apply the patch.

</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> (1) Old revisions must comes first for the + and -
in the patch file to be applied properly by <code>patch</code> util.
(2) Git needs two commits or the stage for diff and will accept
a range of commits but it will igonre the rest!
