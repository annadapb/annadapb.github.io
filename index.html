<h1 class='center'>Annada Behera</h1>
<p class='center emph'>PhD Candidate and Senior Research Fellow at <a
href='https://www.niser.ac.in'>NISER, Bhubaneswar</a>

<h3>Research area</h3>
Complex differential geometry, geometric algebra, information theory
and Bayesian probability theory with applications in computer graphics
(rendering), and data-oriented differentiable programming (for machine
learning).
<h3>Talks and presentation</h3>
<p> Some talks I have presented in past, although some talks before 2021
are missing either because I didn't make or lost the files. Talks are
listed alphabetically.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Notes are evolving documents that reside on the web and act as a
reference. In some sense, it is like "explained config files" and in
others, it is some cool fact about the tools I use that I don't want
to forget. These are my public notes for my own reference. Feel free to
take a look, and let me know if you find these helpful.

<p style="font-size: .9em; font-style: italic;"><b>Comment about
website:</b> It is sad that people don't write HTML these days. Frameworks
like React, Slevte, Vue, etc on top of JavaScript write HTML, with layer
and layers of abstraction. Gone are the days when people used to write
HTML in their text editors for fun. And because, they had something to
share with the world (not because they wanted to profit off of it!) We all
wrote HTML by hand, we looked at the source of HTML files others had
written and we all learned from each other. This website is reminiscent
of the old days and old ways we miss so much.
