<p style="font-size: .9em; font-style: italic;"><b>Comment about
website:</b> It is sad that people don't write HTML these days. Frameworks
like React, Slevte, Vue, etc on top of JavaScript write HTML, with layer
and layers of abstraction. Gone are the days when people used to write
HTML in their text editors for fun. And because, they had something to
share with the world (not because they wanted to profit off of it!) We all
wrote HTML by hand, we looked at the source of HTML files others had
written and we all learned from each other. This website is reminiscent
of the old days and old ways we miss so much.
